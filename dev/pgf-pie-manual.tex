\begin{abstract}
  \texttt{pgf-pie} is a LaTeX package for drawing pie chart. As stated
  by its name, it is based on a very popular graphic package
  \texttt{PGF/TikZ}. This document presents the usage of
  \texttt{pgf-pie} and collects some pie charts as examples.
  \texttt{pgf-pie} can be downloaded from
  \href{http://code.google.com/p/pgf-pie/}{http://code.google.com/p/pgf-pie/}.

\section{The Essentials}

\subsection{First Pie}
\demo[0.6]{first-pie}

\subsection{Radius, Position}
The size of chart can be set by \texttt{radius}, default is 3. The
center of chart can be set by \texttt{pos}, default is \texttt{\{0,0\}}.

\demo{radius}

\subsection{Explode}
\demo{explode}

\subsection{Text Label}

\subsubsection{Text inside pie}
\demo[0.6]{before-after-number}

\subsubsection{Text outside pie}
The value of \texttt{text} can be \texttt{label}(default) or
\texttt{pin}.

\demo[0.6]{text}

\subsection{Sum}
The value of \texttt{sum} indicats the sum of all data in the chart,
it is 100 by default. It can be calculated automatically when
\texttt{auto} is set.
